# HttpRequester
Qt interface to make Http request easily. This interface is a copy of the [HttpRequester](https://github.com/tommut/HttpRequester) plugin for firefox. I have made it because this plugin is only available on Firefox and it is not compatible with [multiprocess](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox).

Then this GUI is similar to the Firefox plugin.

# Features
* Send `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD` and `PATCH` request
* Works with `http`and `https`
* Set custom headers (in the **Headers** tab)
* History of 100 requests maximum (saved on disk)
* Visualize `JSON` in 3 different way: **raw**, **indented** and **tree**
* Request content can be from a file or directly on the text edit

If you have any features that you would like, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Forbinn/HttpRequester/issues).
